# Simple Calculator in C++

This repository contains a basic command-line calculator program implemented in C++. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.

## Features

- User-friendly menu for selecting an operation
- Support for four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Error handling for invalid input
- Option to perform multiple calculations or exit the program

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. This program uses C++11 features, so your compiler should support the C++11 standard or later.

### Compiling and Running

1. Clone the repository or download the `calc.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the `calc.cpp` file.
3. Run the following command to compile the program:

g++ -std=c++11 -o calc calc.cpp


This will create an executable named `calc`.

4. Run the resulting executable with the following command:

./calc


On Windows, use `calc` instead of `./calc`.

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.
